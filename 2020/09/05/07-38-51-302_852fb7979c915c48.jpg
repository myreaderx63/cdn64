<p>About once a week for the past I don&#39;t know how many years, I&#39;ve sectioned a fennel bulb into eighths, washed a handful of cherry tomatoes, put them in a baking dish with a good glug of olive oil (more is better here) and some salt and then stuck it in a 200C/400F oven until the vegetables are tender as can be and the tomatoes have browned and slumped, about 30 minutes, though I confess I&#39;ve never really timed it. I also let the dish cool in the hot oven, which helps the caramelization at the end and then I basically eat the entire thing, unless my husband is around in which case I share. I love this dish so much that I nearly lick the baking dish. It&#39;s easy, it can be made all year long, since even the yuckiest cherry tomatoes come alive with this treatment, and it tastes ambrosial. If I happen to be lucky enough to have some nice sourdough bread around, I pair the vegetables with that for an easy little meal and life feels good.</p>
<p>I love a ritualistic vegetable dish like this that keeps showing up in my life over and over, that never gets old, that I don&#39;t even have to think about when I cook it. Like roasted broccoli, stewed peas, sauteed zucchini - the all-stars of my cooking life. These are the things that flesh out our dinner table night after night and that I imagine my children will remember, either fondly or not, when they look back at the food of their childhood. However, as much as I love these dishes and the comfort they bring me in both flavor and preparation, they are not necessarily stuff for company. They are humble, <em>regular</em> dishes, not show-stopping or even really conversation-worthy. When you&#39;re having people over or if you need to bring a dish to a potluck, I think you kind of need to up your game a little. Not a ton, but enough to make a bit of an impression.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.thewednesdaychef.com/.a/6a00d8341c660253ef0240a441e62f200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Diana Henry Roasted Fennel and Tomato Salad with Chickpeas" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c660253ef0240a441e62f200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://www.thewednesdaychef.com/.a/6a00d8341c660253ef0240a441e62f200c-800wi" title="Diana Henry Roasted Fennel and Tomato Salad with Chickpeas" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, my culinary hero <a href="http://dianahenry.co.uk/">Diana Henry</a> has a recipe for precisely this kind of elevated salad that used roasted fennel and tomatoes as the base, but pumps it up with all kinds of crazy flavorings, like harissa and preserved lemon and balsamic vinegar. It comes from her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Eat-Peach-Stories-Places/dp/1784724114">How to Eat a Peach</a> and is quite a stunner. The addition of chickpeas makes it a slightly more substantial kind of salad and fresh herbs make it beautiful - the kind of thing you can plonk on a buffet table and feel secretly smug about. And also consume rather obsessively. Which is the whole point. One more thing I love about it: the flavorings are so bold and fresh but actually this salad is essentially seasonless, so you can serve it in spring, when people are crazy for asparagus and rhubarb, and you can serve it in winter, when big roasts and stews prevail, and in both cases it just kind of <em>works</em>. Pretty neat.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, I discovered a similar kind of special version of roasted broccoli dish that you need to know about (as in, my father literally said WHAT IS THIS WITCHCRAFT THIS IS THE BEST BROCCOLI I HAVE EVER EATEN when he had it), but I&#39;ll have to save it for next time. My camera, beloved and trusty documentation device on this blog since 2007, died a few weeks ago. Like, right in the middle of taking these photos, which is why I don&#39;t have a photo of the final dish (here&#39;s <a href="https://www.nigella.com/recipes/guests/diana-henrys-roast-tomatoes-fennel-and-chickpeas-with-preserved-lemons-and-honey">one from Diana</a>, though). I thought it just needed a little repair work, but the camera shop guy told me it wasn&#39;t worth it - the repair would cost far more to do than the camera is worth. I was unexpectedly gutted, I have to admit. I loved that camera. I salvaged the lens and put it on my husband&#39;s camera, which is only a few years newer than mine was, but requires a whole new education. So bear with me while I figure that out.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Diana Henry&#39;s Roasted Tomato, Fennel and Chickpea Salad</strong><br /><em>Adapted from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Eat-Peach-Stories-Places/dp/1784724114">How to Eat a Peach</a></em><br /><em>Serves 6</em></p>
<p><strong>For the tomatoes</strong><em><br /></em><span style="font-size: 10pt;">10 large plum tomatoes (or an equivalent amount of cherry tomatoes, left whole)</span><br />3 tbsp olive oil<br />1 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br />1½ tbsp harissa<br />2 tsp sugar<br />Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
<section class="paCmsArticle-section-body">
<div class="paCmsArticle-articleBody ng-binding">
<p class="p4"><strong>For the fennel<br /></strong>2 large fennel bulbs<br />Juice of ½ lemon<br />2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />½ tsp fennel seeds, coarsely crushed in a mortar or left whole<br />Generous pinch of chile flakes<br />2½ tbsp olive oil<br />400g can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed</p>
<p class="p4"><strong>For the dressing<br /></strong>2 small preserved lemons<br />2 tsp juice from the lemon jar<br />2 tbsp white wine vinegar<br />1½ tbsp runny honey<br />5 tbsp olive oil<br />4 tbsp chopped parsley</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Preheat the oven to 190°C (375 F). Halve the tomatoes lengthwise and lay in a single layer in a roasting pan or ovenproof dish. Leave whole if using cherry tomatoes. Mix the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and harissa and pour this over the tomatoes, tossing to coat well, then turn the tomatoes cut sides up. Sprinkle </span>with the sugar and season.</p>
<p class="p6">2. Quarter the fennel bulbs, cut off the stalks and remove any coarse outer leaves. Pull off any tender fronds (reserve these) and cut each piece of fennel into 2.5cm thick wedges, keeping them intact at the base Add the lemon juice, garlic, fennel seeds, chile and olive oil, then season and turn everything over with your hands. Spread out the fennel in a second roasting tin and cover tightly with foil.</p>
<p class="p6">3. Put both trays in the oven. Roast the fennel for 25-30 minutes, until tender (the undersides should be pale gold), then remove the foil and roast for another 5-10 minutes, or until soft, golden and slightly charred. Roast the tomatoes for 35-40 minutes, or until caramelized in patches and slightly shrunken. Stir the chickpeas into the fennel and taste for seasoning. Leave both to cool to room temperature.</p>
<p class="p6">4. Now make the dressing. Discard the flesh from the preserved lemons and dice the rind. <span class="s1">Whisk the preserved lemon juice with the wine vinegar, honey and olive oil, season and add the lemon rind and parsley. Taste for seasoning and sweet-sour balance.</span></p>
<p class="p6">5. Arrange the fennel, chickpeas and tomatoes on a platter, adding the juices from the roasting tins; there might be quite a bit from the tomatoes. Scatter any fennel fronds you reserved over the top. Spoon on the dressing. (Leftover dressing can be used on other salads or to zhuzz up mayo for chicken or tuna salad.)</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.thewednesdaychef.com/.a/6a00d8341c660253ef0240a495d628200b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_8622" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c660253ef0240a495d628200b image-full img-responsive" src="https://www.thewednesdaychef.com/.a/6a00d8341c660253ef0240a495d628200b-800wi" title="IMG_8622" /></a><br />Here&#39;s a funny-well-not-really anecdote for you:</p>
<p>Our morning routine is very rushed. Hugo has to be up by 6:10 at the latest to have enough time to get dressed, eat breakfast, brush his teeth and get out the door (with shoes, jacket and scarf on, preferably) by 6:55 to catch the school bus. While the boys have their breakfast, their dad&#39;s showering and getting dressed (he has to leave at the same time Hugo does and has a nearly 2-hour commute each way), I&#39;m chatting with them, packing Hugo&#39;s snack box and pounding down some kind of hot drink to keep from falling over.</p>
<p>Hugo&#39;s favorite weekday breakfast are toasted English muffins with peanut butter and jam. We don&#39;t always have English muffins around, and on those days, he&#39;s happy enough to settle for whatever bread we do have (it&#39;s usually some kind of dark German rye thing), as long as it&#39;s spread with PB &amp; J. (Occasionally, he will decide it&#39;s butter instead of PB that he wants. That is fine!) Bruno&#39;s favorite breakfast is oatmeal with frozen blueberries. That child will plow through an adult portion first thing, then basically refuse to eat more than a bite of this and that at lunch and dinner. Small mercies.</p>
<p>Now, <em>this</em> morning, since there were no English muffins, I decided to make oatmeal for both boys. I do have to grudgingly admit that I sort of had an inkling (oh, ho ho ho) there was going to be some kind of pushback (ha ha haaa), so I pumped up the oatmeal with chopped apples and cinnamon and brown sugar (which I usually never add), added frozen blueberries for good measure, even drizzled the top with maple syrup. All their favorite things! What lucky boys! They were definitely going to gobble this up, weren&#39;t they? I ignored my misgivings, dished it up, place the bowls on the table and...then...</p>
<p>Both children contemplated their breakfast. Hugo made a face and asked me where his English muffin was. &quot;There are none. <em>This</em> is your breakfast today!&quot; I grinned in what I hoped was an encouraging way, but I suspect was slightly more maniacal. Who knows; I was still feeling pretty chipper in that moment. You know, pride cometh before a fall and all that. I mean, Hugo used to <em>love</em> oatmeal with blueberries, just like his baby brother! Two years ago, yeah, but still! What could go wrong?</p>
<p>He took a tentative bite, while Bruno dug in briefly. Then Hugo put down his spoon and refused to eat anymore. Bruno watched and followed suit. And then my head exploded. Parenthood! Ain&#39;t it a kick in the head?</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.thewednesdaychef.com/.a/6a00d8341c660253ef0240a4480ed0200c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_8496" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c660253ef0240a4480ed0200c image-full img-responsive" src="https://www.thewednesdaychef.com/.a/6a00d8341c660253ef0240a4480ed0200c-800wi" title="IMG_8496" /></a></p>
<p>The reason I&#39;m telling you this is because I feel like the recipe I <em>actually</em> want to share today is exactly the same kind of thing as that lovely oatmeal: on the face of it absolutely harmless and tasty, yet still a total minefield waiting to happen. Nevertheless, I promise you that you will want these little ricotta-spinach frittatine for your back pocket. Even if your crazy children won&#39;t eat them, YOU will. And you can bring them to any school buffet, bake sale, book club potluck, WHATEVER, and they&#39;ll be the first thing eaten and grown-ups will pester you for the recipe. Ask me how I know.</p>
<p>The recipe comes from my beloved <a href="https://benandbirdy.blogspot.com/">Catherine Newman</a>, who writes a column about low-carb recipes for <a href="https://diatribe.org/">diaTribe.org</a>, which is a website for people with diabetes, which I do not have, but Catherine&#39;s recipes are always very good and also family-friendly so I follow her everywhere she goes and cook almost anything she tells me to. Especially these mini cheese-and-vegetable frittatine.</p>
<p>The frittatine are made with eggs, a lot of grated cheese, ricotta and some vegetables and herbs. I&#39;ve used spinach and broccoli, both to rave reviews. I&#39;ve used grated Cheddar and grated Gouda, both to rave reviews. What I&#39;m trying to say is that they are very flexible things. They&#39;re easy to make, bake up cute in muffin tins and store well in the fridge. I love how portable they are and how much flavor is packed into each little round. I use less ricotta and cheese than Catherine does, but to no ill-effect. These are versatile and easy and I love them, yes, I do.</p>
<p>The first time I made them, they were for a school buffet, but I gave the first two to Hugo and Bruno to see if they liked them. I was pretty sure they would! Spoiler alert: They did not. Fair enough. Luckily, <em>I</em> thought they were scrumptious. And at the school buffet, they were gone in minutes. Vindication! A pathetic one, but still. My sense is that if your children like cheese and scrambled eggs, there&#39;s a good chance they&#39;ll like them. But they might not. In that case, try to be better than me and just appreciate the fact that you now have a batch of delicious cheesy vegetable egg bites for <em>your</em> breakfast all week.</p>
<p>Off to buy more English muffins, maybe two packages, now.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Newman&#39;s Ricotta and Spinach Frittatine</strong><br /><em>Makes 12 mini frittatine</em><br /><em>Adapted from </em><a href="https://diatribe.org/cheesy-mini-ricotta-frittatas"><em>diaTribe.org</em></a></p>
<p>3 tablespoons olive oil<br />1 small onion, chopped<br />1 garlic clove, minced<br />3 eggs<br />250 grams (8.8 ounces) whole-milk ricotta <br />1 heaping cup grated cheddar, gouda or mozzarella <br />1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan<br />3 cups chopped baby spinach (around 6 ounces) or equal amount of steamed, chopped broccoli or frozen spinach<br />1-2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh herbs (like parsley, chives, basil or a lesser amount of thyme or marjoram)<br />3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br />Black pepper</p>
<p>1. Heat the oven to 350 and grease the 12 wells of a standard muffin tin.</p>
<p>2. Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat and sauté the onion until soft and browning, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, cook another minute, then add the spinach and cook until just wilted, about 1 minute.</p>
<p>3. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, then add the cheeses and stir. Add the vegetables, the herbs, and the salt and pepper, and stir well.</p>
<p>4. Divide the mixture in the muffin cups and bake 15-20 minutes until puffed, deeply golden, and set. Eat right away or refrigerate.</p>

<p>Thank you all so much for your incredibly warm and lovely messages! It&#39;s so nice to be back and know that all of you are out there still reading.</p>
<p>Today I&#39;m going to tell you about how I deal with the daily grind of WTF AM I MAKING FOR DINNER TONIGHT that makes even the most eager cook a little, shall we say, <em>itchy</em>. I don&#39;t know how many of you here are also following me on Instagram, where I mentioned this new way of meal planning back in January, so forgive me if this is a little repetitive, but I really do find it such a helpful way of working through the constant and unrelenting chore of having dinner on the table every evening that perhaps it can be useful to a few of you too.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I do: rather than sit down and write down a whole menu for each day of the week when meal planning (which was time consuming and eventually felt very...uninteresting and difficult), I decided to assign specifically themed meals to specific days of the week in a much looser fashion. Like this: On Mondays, we eat pasta. On Tuesdays, it&#39;s beans. Wednesdays are for chicken. Thursdays are soups or stews. Fridays is for fish. (Weekends are a free-for-all.) What this allows me is much more flexibility and also more rigidity at the same time, but in a way that feels both freeing and safe. Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Since Mondays are for pasta, it means that the week starts out very gently. All I need to do is make a pot of tomato sauce, which I could do in my sleep, and some green vegetable (sometimes, yes, it&#39;s just a sliced cucumber because I am only human, other times it&#39;s steamed broccoli or boiled chard). Dinner is very easy and almost always drama-free, because the boys both eat noodles and everyone&#39;s happy. It allows me to start the week off feeling somewhat capable and in control.</p>
<p>Tuesday is bean day and I usually end up making some kind of simple bean situation in the Instant Pot. <a href="https://lifemadesimplebakes.com/2018/04/no-soak-instant-pot-pinto-beans/">This recipe</a> (using Rancho Gordo cranberry beans, for example!) is wonderful and Bruno will eat at least three helpings of it. WHUT. I want to marry that recipe. The boys eat it plain or with a bit of bread and Hugo will have some avocado with it. We top it with cilantro and hot sauce and pickled onions and avocado. Sometimes, though, life is too crazy even for the Instant Pot and then I make a red or yellow lentil soup, which takes about 20 minutes and while Hugo will bellyache about it, both kids will usually eat it. (Obviously, it helps if I slice a hot dog into the soup, but I don&#39;t always do that because I don&#39;t want them to get used to hot dogs on the regular because I am MEAN and also sort of stupid seeing as we live in Germany and they already are used to eating them all the time everywhere gaaaaah.)</p>
<p>Wednesday is Chicken Day. Sometimes I make <a href="https://www.thewednesdaychef.com/the_wednesday_chef/2014/07/cooking-for-hugo-corinne-trangs-korean-barbecued-chicken.html">this Korean chicken</a>, sometimes I make breaded cutlets (but let&#39;s be honest, rarely, because that set-up is way too time-consuming and annoying at this point in my life - I mean, keep in mind that unless there&#39;s a second adult here, I can&#39;t set foot in the kitchen without Bruno behind me dismantling literally everything in sight or physically hanging off of me or Hugo asking if he is finally allowed to watch something NO YOU CANNOT AND IF YOU ASK ME ONE MORE TIME CHILD I SWEAR TO...), but recently I discovered <a href="http://dianahenry.co.uk/">Diana Henry</a>&#39;s baked chicken and it is so delicious and so easy and so...satisfying and impressive and perfect that it makes me happy every time I make it.</p>
<p>You make a soft little mixture of Dijon mustard, butter and herbs (she calls for tarragon, but I end up usually just using a bit of dried sage or nothing at all), then squash this all over a bunch of chicken thighs. Then you sprinkle breadcrumbs on top and stick it in the oven until browned and crisp. That&#39;s it. The crispy top pleases the children, the herbs and mustard make it sophisticated enough to not give you an existential crisis and it&#39;s on the table (from start to finish!) in 40 minutes. (The active time of 5 minutes is fast enough that I can trick the kids into leaving me alone while I do it.) SO GOOD.</p>
<p>It&#39;s one of only two recipes actually printed out and pasted to my refrigerator, that&#39;s how much I love it. (The other one is for <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/buckwheat_pancakes/">this</a>, but with yogurt/milk instead of buttermilk.)</p>
<p>The original recipe specifies chicken thighs (skinless, but bone-in) and it is definitely the way to go. HOWEVER, because of course, I have also tried this with skinless, boneless chicken breasts and while it&#39;s not nearly as juicy and toothsome and rich, it&#39;s totally fine. Just reduce the cooking time to 20 minutes and then use the broiler for 3 minutes at the end to brown and crisp the breadcrumbs. (The photos in this post are of the chicken breasts.)</p>
<p>The recipe comes from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bird-Hand-Chicken-recipes-every/dp/178472002X">Diana&#39;s chicken cookbook</a> and is definitely, positively, absolutely worth the price of the book. For some godforsaken reason, I only own this book on my Kindle, which drives me fucking bananas, because if I want to cook anything else from it, I have to keep re-entering my password and peering at the phone and then my children see me on the phone and then they WANT the phone and my fingers are dirty and stop screaming and oh my god no you can&#39;t have a snack and you can&#39;t have the phone and please go play and ten more minutes and I hate everything and I really don&#39;t understand why cookbooks even <em>come</em> in E-book form, it&#39;s so dumb.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.thewednesdaychef.com/.a/6a00d8341c660253ef0240a46b041e200d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mustard butter" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341c660253ef0240a46b041e200d image-full img-responsive" src="https://www.thewednesdaychef.com/.a/6a00d8341c660253ef0240a46b041e200d-800wi" title="Mustard butter" /></a></p>
<p>Thursdays are soup/stew days, which means that sometimes we eat some sort of bean stew twice a week, but there are worse things, yes? Usually it&#39;s some sort of puréed vegetable soup and bread. Thank goodness for German bread, which is about 80% of what Bruno eats in total, period. And sometimes, depending on just how much of a surrender week it is, it&#39;s the day the boys get pastina in broth (as in bouillon cube or <a href="https://www.betterthanbouillon.com/">Better Than Bouillon</a>) and I fantasize about being capable of drinking three glasses of wine at dinner (I can&#39;t even do one glass, just so you know, which seems really unfair).</p>
<p>Fridays are fish (and frozen peas). Either I stick a bunch of frozen fillets in tomato sauce and serve over rice from the rice cooker, or boiled potatoes if I&#39;m feeling charitable, or it&#39;s fish sticks. And then my husband roots around in the pantry looking for the instant mashed potatoes because you can&#39;t possibly have one without the other and I decide that instead of dinner, I&#39;m having a bath and listening to a podcast and no, please don&#39;t follow me, in fact, forget I even exist, someone else is in charge now good night and good luck.</p>
<p>Please, PLEASE, you well-meaning, lovely, wonderful people, do not tell me how quickly this phase will be over and that I&#39;ll miss it one day. PLEASE. I am fully aware of that. As in every day. It sometimes keeps me up at night! It also does not usually make me feel better in the moment. You know? Sometimes you just have to live it and be frustrated and tired and happy when the kids are finally asleep and that&#39;s okay too.</p>
<p><strong>Diana Henry&#39;s Baked Chicken with Dijon Mustard and Herbs</strong><br /><em>Serves 4</em><br /><em>Adapted from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/178472002X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2">A Bird in the Hand</a></em></p>
<p>1/4 cup Dijon mustard<br />A couple of pinches of chopped fresh herbs (like tarragon, thyme, oregano, basil, what have you)<br />1 3/4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened<br />4 skinless, bone-in chicken thighs<br />Salt and pepper<br />2-3 tbsp bread crumbs (from stale, not fresh, bread)</p>
<p>1. Preheat the oven to 425F. Mash the Dijon mustard with the tarragon and butter until combined. Put the chicken into a roasting pan (or a baking dish) and brush or use your fingers to spread the mustard mixture onto the chicken. Season, then press on the bread crumbs.<br /><br />2. Roast in the hot oven for 35 minutes. The chicken should be cooked through. Check this by piercing the flesh near the bone, with the tip of a sharp knife, in one of the larger pieces. The juices should run clear with no trace of pink. If not, cook for a few minutes more then test again. The top should be a lovely golden color.<br /><br />3. Serve immediately with the cooking juices that have gathered around the chicken.</p>

<p>It was my father&#39;s birthday the other day and to celebrate, I used my Instant Pot to make the Korean-flavored brisket from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Instant-Recipes-Pressure-Multicooker/dp/1524762962">Dinner in an Instant</a> and it was astonishingly delicious and done in less than an afternoon. What?! (Yes, I am still in that annoying phase of Instant Pot ownership where I cannot get over how fast it is. People, meltingly tender, practically spoonable brisket! In less than three hours! I mean!) (I actually used Tafelspitz, because my butcher didn&#39;t have any Rinderbrust that day, in case any of you are in Germany and want to make this too, and it was great.)</p>
<p>To round out the meal, I made white rice and <a href="http://www.dinneralovestory.com/anatomy-of-weeknight-dinner-slow-cooker-korean-tacos/">this slaw from Dinner: A Love Story</a>, which isn&#39;t Korean per se, but Jenny also serves it with something called &quot;Korean Tacos&quot; so I figured it would do as a low-energy vegetable side and you might not believe it if you had only tasted the ambrosial brisket, but this slaw basically stole the show. Now I know why Jenny&#39;s Andy said their Korean taco meal really &quot;was all about the slaw.&quot; This slaw is <em>perfect</em>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s fresh and crisp and perfectly seasoned, with rice vinegar and fish sauce and lime, and just the kind of thing you don&#39;t want to stop crunching your way through. You&#39;ll have to restrain yourself from spooning up the juices left in the empty bowl. I added chopped salted peanuts, because I correctly guessed that Hugo might be slightly more inclined to eat it if there were peanuts to fish out, and I urge you to do the same. Using Napa cabbage means the slicing is a cinch and you don&#39;t need to massage anything or make it in advance. You just dump everything in a bowl and go to town. (I made this two nights in a row and added thinly sliced celery to the slaw the second night, which I also highly recommend!) The cilantro is non-negotiable. WHAAAAAT.</p>
<p>I feel like calling this Perfect Slaw might confuse you because it&#39;s not cole slaw. But calling it Asian Slaw feels a little lazy? Vietnamese Slaw? Napa Slaw? I don&#39;t know. These are the kinds of things I waste time thinking about. Just bookmark it, commit it to memory (I already have) and soon it won&#39;t matter at all what it&#39;s called. Or you&#39;ll just be calling it Perfect Slaw too.</p>

<p>Pssst...</p>
<p>It&#39;s me.</p>
<p>I know. It&#39;s been, like, 8 months.</p>
<p>(Insert chagrined grin emoji.)</p>
<p>I nearly shut this thing down. No, really. But I couldn&#39;t pull the trigger! So here I am again. I missed you guys.</p>
<p>What&#39;s been going on? Well, Bruno turned two. Hugo learned how to read and write. In many ways, things are just fine. In other ways, though, the past year has been really difficult. Just life, you know? Nothing spectacular or out-of-the-ordinary. Mothering two young children, noodling forward in a marriage, trying to figure out my career, dealing with money issues...but to top it all off, I&#39;ve recently been diagnosed with a string of stress-related health problems. I knew something was off last year already, but couldn&#39;t put my finger on it. This year, so far, my body has been telling me in no uncertain terms to spend a little more time saying no, putting myself first and finding peace.</p>
<p><em>Easier said than done! yelled a million mothers in exasperation as she skulked off to a corner to use her phone to meditate. (Insert eye roll emoji.)</em></p>
<p>It&#39;s been scary and humbling and also kind of nuts to witness my body manifest a lot of the crap that I do not do a good job of managing. And I&#39;m kind of overwhelmed at how much willpower it takes to take care of myself. I feel like I&#39;m a total champ at taking care of other people, so it&#39;s doubly weird to realize that I&#39;m really failing at <em>me</em>. I&#39;m sort of embarrassed by that. I&#39;m also embarrassed about this paragraph! Let&#39;s move on.</p>
<p>Feeding the children has pretty much become a shit show. Hugo has the appetite of a small bird. Bruno is incredibly picky. (The only green thing he eats are spicy olives.) (THE ONLY GREEN THING.) (SPICY.) (MOTHERLOVING.) (OLIVES.) Every once in a blue moon, I throw my hands up and make alphabet noodle soup with a bouillon cube because it&#39;s Hugo&#39;s favorite thing to eat (insert exploding head emoji) and because Bruno will usually eat it too. But most of the time, I cook the food I want to eat (within reason, people) and then there&#39;s a lot of whining and uneaten food and smoke comes out of my ears and no matter what I&#39;ve made, the meal always ends with Bruno eating chunks of Parmesan cheese.</p>
<p>Because, surrender!</p>
<p>(I read that in a lovely cookbook called <a href="https://www.jessicabattilana.com/repertoire">Repertoire by Jessica Battilana</a> - in a headnote about newborns and surviving and fattoush salad - last spring and spontaneously burst into tears because it was so profound and wise and right and also WTF why are children so difficult? I sometimes debate going around my house and taping pieces of paper with SURRENDER written on them to the walls. You know, just to remind me.)</p>
<p>Last year, I also discovered this chili from <a href="https://www.melissaclark.net/">Melissa Clark</a>&#39;s most recent cookbook (via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Changing-Game-Melissa-Clark/dp/0553448234">Whoorl</a>, but I can&#39;t remember in what context) and there were a few brief, shining evenings in which the children and Max and I all enjoyed eating it. Since then, Bruno has decided that ground meat is for the dogs and Hugo hates stew, but Max and I continue to think that this is an exceptionally delicious chili. (It&#39;s also a delight to make, which seems important if you derive some modicum joy from cooking, as most of us here do? I hope?) It has sage and beer in it, plus cheddar on top, and it&#39;s just really satisfying and wonderful. I&#39;d call it my favorite chili.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Clark&#39;s Pork and Black Bean Chili</strong><br /><strong>From <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Changing-Game-Melissa-Clark/dp/0553448234">Dinner: Changing the Game</a></strong><br /><em>Serves 4 to 6</em></p>
<p>2 tbsp olive oil<br />1 large onion, diced<br />1 red pepper, diced<br />1 pound ground pork (or turkey)<br />2 tsp kosher salt, plus more if needed<br />1 tsp freshly ground black pepper<br />2 tsp dried oregano<br />1 tbsp minced fresh sage<br />1 tbsp chili powder, plus more if needed<br />2 minced garlic cloves<br />1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes<br />2 15-ounce cans black beans, drained and rinsed<br />1/4 cup lager (like Negra Modelo)<br />Grated cheddar or sour cream, for serving (optional)<br />Lime wedges, for serving</p>
<p>1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Add the onion and pepper; cook, stirring, until the vegetables have softened and lightly browned, about 7&#0160; minutes. Add the pork and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until it is cooked, about 7 minutes. Stir in the salt, pepper, oregano, sage, chili powder and garlic and cook for 1 minute.</p>
<p>2. Add the tomatoes and their liquid, the black beans and the beer. Stir and bring the mixture to a boil. Then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the mixture is slightly thickened, 30 to 40 minutes. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. Serve topped with grated cheese (or sour cream) and with the lime.</p>
